1. Creating Variables
		Declare both of the variables at the top of the code
  
2. Prompting
		Use the input function in your specific programming language to ask the user the given amount and the charged amount
    Store them in their respective variables 

3. Validating the user input
		Ensure that your program only accepts non-negative integers
		If the userâ€™s input is valid move to the next step
		Else display an error message and exit the program
	
4. Calculate change
		Subtract the charged amount from the total given amount.

5. Determine the bills and coins
		Run the function that will calculate the first bill in the change amount
		Suppose the first bill (currency note) is 10 as x
		Run the loop that will subtract x amount from the change and increments in the count for that x bill (currency note) variable until the amount is greater than x
		Repeat the above step for the next bill (currency note) until the amount is greater than 0
  
6. Print the bills and coins
		Use the output function of the language to print the bills and coins to the user
