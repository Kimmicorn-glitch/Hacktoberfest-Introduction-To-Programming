1. Create a function that takes 2 arguments, amount due and amount paid
2. In the function, create a list of bill and coin denominations in descending order
3. Create a variable to store the change owed, which is the amount paid minus the amount due
4. Create an empty dictionary to store the change owed in the correct denominations
4. Loop through the list of denominations
5. For each iteration, if the change owed is greater than or equal to the current denomination, while that condition is true, 
add that denomination to the dictionary as a key with a value of 1 that increments each time the loop runs and subtract that denomination from the change owed
6. Return the dictionary
