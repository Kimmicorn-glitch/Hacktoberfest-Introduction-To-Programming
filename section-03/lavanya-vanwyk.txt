APPROACH:

- Write code that takes a file and reads its extension, done for all files in the folder


FIRST SUB-PROBLEM:

1. Code should be able to read the names of files in the target directory
  * If a file somehow does not have an extension, the code should account for this as well
  * The code should also store the number of files that don't have an extension 
    ** Possibly by incrementing a count
3. The code should store a set of all the extensions as strings
  * A set ensures no duplicates
  * This is preparation for solving problem 2: For each item in the set, a folder will be created with the item's value (string)
