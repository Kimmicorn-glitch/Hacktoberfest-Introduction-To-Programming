- Pick vegetables and herbs suited to your climate and preferences.


2. Plan the Layout
- Organize your garden for maximum efficiency and yield.
- Pair plants that help each other grow (e.g., basil and tomatoes).
- Space plants nicely to avoid overcrowding.
- Leave space for walking or tending to plants.

3. Prepare the Soil
- Create a healthy foundation for your plants.
- Clear the area: Remove grass, weeds, and debris.
- Loosen the soil by digging and tilling
- Add compost, aged manure, or organic soil amendments.

4. Planting

- Water immediately after planting and regularly thereafter.

5. Maintenance
- Keep the garden healthy and productive.
- Consistently water based on plant needs.
- Remove weeds regularly to reduce competition.
- Use organic or balanced fertilizer as needed.
- Monitor for pests and use natural remedies or barriers if possible.
