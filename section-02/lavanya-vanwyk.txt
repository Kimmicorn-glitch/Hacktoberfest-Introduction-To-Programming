Problem (technical): Create a script that organizes files in a specified folder by sorting them into subfolders based on their file extensions. 
Divide your approach into small doable steps.

APPROACH:

- Write code that takes a file and reads its extension, done for all files in the folder
- Write code that adds all the unique extensions to a list (ie. no duplicates)
- Write code that creates empty folders from the list unique extensions
- Write code that moves the files to their respective folders

Example structure:

function check_files(files):
-> read file name
-> if file name not in a list of unique extensions, add it and move on

function create_folders(extension list):
-> for the unique extensions in the list, create a folder

function organize_files():
-> for all the subfolders in the directory, match file extension to the folder name
