Understand the Goal:
The main purpose is to sort files into folders depending on their what the extensions might be .

Prompt the User for Input:
->Ask the user to provide the folder path that contains the files to organize.

->Make sure to validate that the folder exists before continuing

->Get a List of Files:
  Retrieve all items in the folder using a method like os.listdir() (in Python).

->Filter out directories files only.

->Identify Each File’s Extension:
  For each file, extract the extension (e.g., using os.path.splitext()).

->Handle special cases where files have no extension.
  Create Subfolders for Each Extension

->For each unique file extension, check if a folder with that extension name exists.
  If it doesn’t exist, create one (e.g., “Images”, “Documents”, or just “.jpg_files”).

->Move Files to the Correct Folder:
  Move each file into its corresponding subfolder using a file-moving function (like shutil.move() in Python).

->Handle potential errors such as permission issues or duplicate files.

->Display a Summary Report:
  After organizing, show the user a summary of what happened:
  How many files were moved?
  Which folders were created?
  If any files couldn’t be moved?
